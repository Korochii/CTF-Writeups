## Writeup
Upon reading and understanding the code in the given file, it seems like it is trying to encrypt the flag before displaying its output to the user.
In this case, the output is also given to us as a comment at the end of the code.
To obtain the flag, we simply need to "decrypt" the output (we can simply reuse the encryption function to do so), which I have done in script.py

## Flag
ictf{my_gift_to_you_is_this_:_another_easy_chall}
