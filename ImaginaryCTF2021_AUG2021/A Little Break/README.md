## Writeup
Upon reading and understanding the code in the given file, it seems like it is trying to encrypt the flag before displaying its output to the user.<br></br>
In this case, the output is also given to us as a comment at the end of the code.<br></br>
To obtain the flag, we simply need to "decrypt" the output (we can simply reuse the encryption function to do so), which I have done in script.py

## Flag
ictf{my_gift_to_you_is_this_:_another_easy_chall}
