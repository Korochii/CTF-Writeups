## Writeup
After unzipping, I realised that it contains multiple folders/files in each folders. The brute-force option is always available, but it will take an extremely large amount of time. We can simply use the recursive command below to obtain the flag instantly.

`grep -r ctf hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia`

## Flag
ictf{grep_-r_to_the_rescue}
