# Rules of Engagement

## Category
Programming

## Description
The rules are simple. If the number is divisible by two, shift it right by one. Otherwise, if it is a multiple of five, divide by five. If it is neither but it is a multiple of three, then add eight. Repeat this process until it yields the flag.

## Writeup

On each iteration, we can use the rules provided to convert the array of decimal numbers to a new set of numbers, which can then be converted to an ASCII text.
We will repeat this until the flag is found (I realised it will take 5 iterations since the first number can become 105 eventually which is equivalent to the letter 'i').

## Flag
ictf{G00d_Var1abl3_Nam3s_R_Th3ir_0wn_R3ward}
